# 4chan External Sounds (Gallery Fix)

Fork of [4chan External Sounds](https://sleazyfork.org/en/scripts/31045-4chan-external-sounds) by Bakugo which works with the gallery
view in [4chanX](https://www.4chan-x.net).

[Install userscript](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/elttil/4chan-External-Sound-Gallery-Fix/master/script.user.js) (use with Greasemonkey / Violentmonkey / Tampermonkey / JS Blocker / etc.)

# Bugs

After testing I have realised there is bug where audio clips will not
play if you are scrolling through the gallery to reach the file but they
will play if you press on the specfic file you want to play. This has to
do with how the script detects a new file is playing. I will fix this
soon.
